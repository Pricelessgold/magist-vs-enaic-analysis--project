# 📊 Magist vs ENIAC — Strategic Partner Analysis

## Project Overview
This project evaluates whether **Magist** is a suitable logistics and marketplace partner for **ENIAC**, a company specializing in high-tech products.  
The analysis focuses on two critical decision factors:
- Availability of high-tech products  
- Delivery performance  

The goal is to support **data-driven decision-making** for potential strategic partnership selection.


## Business Problem
ENIAC requires a partner that:
- Offers a strong presence of high-tech products  
- Delivers products quickly and reliably to meet customer expectations  

The key question is whether Magist’s marketplace and logistics performance align with these requirements.



## Key Questions
- Does Magist’s product catalog contain a sufficient share of high-tech products?
- How does Magist’s delivery speed compare to ENIAC’s expectations?
- Can Magist support ENIAC’s operational and customer satisfaction goals?



## Data Description
The analysis uses Magist’s relational database, including:
- Product and category data  
- Order and delivery timestamps  
- Sales and logistics information  

The dataset enables evaluation of both **product composition** and **delivery performance metrics**.



## Methodology

### SQL
Used to:
- Query and join product, order, and delivery tables  
- Classify product categories and identify high-tech items  
- Calculate delivery times and performance indicators  

### Tableau
Used to:
- Visualize product category distribution  
- Analyze delivery time patterns  
- Compare performance against business expectations  




## Key Findings
- Magist offers a broad range of products, but **high-tech items represent a small proportion** of the catalog.
- **Average delivery times** are significantly slower than ENIAC’s operational requirements.
- Delivery performance shows **high variability**, posing a risk to customer satisfaction.



## Conclusion
Based on product availability and delivery performance, **Magist does not meet ENIAC’s strategic needs** for a high-tech-focused partnership.  
The analysis suggests that ENIAC should seek **alternative partners** better aligned with its product specialization and delivery standards.



## Limitations & Future Improvements
- The analysis is based on historical data and does not account for recent operational changes.
- Future work could include:
  - Customer satisfaction metrics  
  - Cost comparison with alternative partners  
  - Scenario analysis for improved logistics performance
